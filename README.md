## Optimizations

### Done
* May 2023: Upgraded from Font Awesome v5 to Font Awesome v6 and ensured backwards compatibility
* May 2023: Updated color schemes and SVGs throughout

### To Do
* Make form submissions live
* Consider ways to showcase more freelance work, blog posts, web development experiments, and more

## Lessons Learned:

* May 2023: It took me hours to upgrade from Font Awesome 5 to Font Awesome 6, including making things overly complicated by trying to also upgrade from webfonts to javascript and SVG. In the end many debugging techniques and strategies (such as using VS Code's native comparison features) were learned, but starting carefully from the original documentation all over again was the key. Sometimes we make things more complicated than they need to be, and the effort is not worth the anticipated reward! There is a balance between things working exactly the way you **want** versus exactly the way you **need**. The future is always open to refactoring!
